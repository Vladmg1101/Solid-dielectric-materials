# Solid-dielectric-materials
The work allows the determination of the complex relative permittivity and the analysis of the behavior of it in frequency (100MHz - 1GHz), for dielectric materials with polarization temporary, frequently used in the electronics industry, either as a dielectric material for capacitors, either as printed wiring support.
This project is written in Microsoft Word and Excel in romanian with all the necessary calculation included.
